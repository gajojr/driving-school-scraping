1. First you'll need to setup selenium on your machine here's a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjv1sY630Uc) to video how to do that
2. You'll ned to install [mysql community](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/), install bigger version
3. pip install myqsl-connector
4. In cmd try typing python then enter
5. >> import mysql
6. If it doesn't show an error you are good to go
7. I was unable to install connector properly so I got "caching_sha2_password' is not supported" error, if you get this error just:
pip install MySQL-connector-python
